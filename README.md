## Why Git Exists
Git was created to solve five fundamental problems developers face.
- Time Travel - Go back to any point in your project's history
- Experiment Safely - Try new ideas without breaking your working version
- Collaborate Smoothly - Multiple people working simultaneously without conflicts
- Accountability - Who changed what, when, and why?
- Recovery - Undo mistakes or restore deleted work

### Version Control Philosophy
In modern software development, tracking changes, managing multiple versions of code, and collaborating efficiently are essential. These challenges are solved using Version Control Systems (VCS).
Git is the most widely used version control system in the world, helping developers work confidently on both personal projects and large team-based codebases.

Git allows developers to:
- Track every change made to a project
- Maintain multiple versions without copying files manually
- Collaborate smoothly with individuals or teams

### What Is Version Control?
Before understanding Git, it’s important to understand version control itself.

Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time. It allows developers to manage the history of a project safely and efficiently.

With version control, developers can:

- Save and Track Changes: Every modification to the codebase is recorded, along with who made the change and why.\
- Revert to Previous Versions: If a bug is introduced or something breaks, developers can restore the project to an earlier, stable version.
- Collaborate Safely: Multiple developers can work on the same project at the same time without overwriting each other’s work.
- Branch and Merge: Developers can create branches for new features or fixes, work independently, and merge their changes back into the main code when ready.

### Introduction to Git
Git is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

Unlike centralized systems, Git allows each developer to work on a local copy of the entire project, including its full history. Developers can then share their work by pushing changes to a shared remote repository.

Git provides several powerful features that make it ideal for modern development:

🔹 Version Tracking: All changes are tracked in a structured history, allowing easy rollbacks to previous versions.

🔹 Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts.

🔹 Branching: Developers can create separate branches for features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.

🔹 Distributed System: Each developer has a full copy of the repository, removing dependency on a single central server.

🔹 Commit History (Logs): Git maintains a detailed record of commits, making it easy to understand how and why a project has evolved.

### Git vs GitHub
- Git is a version control system that runs on your local machine. It tracks code changes, keeps history, and lets you undo mistakes. It works even without internet.

- GitHub is a cloud platform that hosts Git repositories. It lets developers share code, review changes, and collaborate using pull requests and issues.

## Git Workflow States

</p>

### git init (Start of Everything)

**What it does**
- Initializes a new Git repository in your project folder.
- Creates a hidden .git/ directory.

**What changes**
- Before git init: Folder is just normal files (Git doesn’t know anything)
- After git init: Git starts tracking changes

**Key idea**
- git init turns a normal folder into a Git repository.

### .git Directory (Behind the Scenes)
**What it contains**

- Complete project history
- Commits, branches, tags
- Configuration and metadata

**Important**
- You never manually edit .git
- Git reads and writes here automatically

**Key idea**
- .git is the brain of Git.

### Working Tree (Working Directory)
**What it is**
- Your actual project files
- Where you write code, edit files, delete things

**State**
- Files can be:
- Modified
- New (untracked)
- Deleted

**Key idea**
- Working tree = your current workspace.
### Staging Area (Index)
**What it is**
- A preparation area before committing
- You choose what goes into the next commit

**Why it exists**
- You might change many files
- But only want to commit some of them

**Key idea**
- Staging is a “review table” before saving history.

### git add

**What it does**
- Takes a snapshot of selected file changes
- Moves them into the staging area

**Important**
- It does NOT create a commit
- It prepares content for commit

**Key idea**
- git add selects what will be recorded.

### Local Repository (Local Branch)
**What it is**
- Stored inside .git
- Contains committed snapshots (history

**Key idea**
- Local repo = permanent project history on your machine.


### git commit

**What it does**
- Saves a snapshot of staged files
- Creates a commit object with:
- Unique hash
- Author
- Date
- Commit message

**Best practice**
- One logical change per commit
- Clear message (what & why)

**Key idea**
- Commit = save point in project history.

### Commit History (git log)

**What it shows**
- Timeline of project changes
- Ordered list of commits

**Key idea**
- Git history tells the story of your project.

### Remote Repository
**What it is**
- Central shared repository
- Usually hosted on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

**Purpose**
- Collaboration
- Backup
- Code sharing

**Key idea**
- Remote repo is for sharing, not required for Git to work.


### Remote Branch (origin/main)
**What it represents**
- Actual branch on the remote server

**Key idea**
- Remote branch lives on the server

### Remote-Tracking Branch

**What it is**
- Local reference of remote branch
- Read-only pointer

**Key idea**
- Remote-tracking branch shows “what the remote looks like”.

### git push
**What it does**
- Sends local commits to remote repository

**Key idea**
- Push = publish your work.

### git fetch
**What it does**
- Downloads changes from remote
- Does NOT modify your working files

**Key idea**
- Fetch = check what others have done.

### git pull

**What it does**
- git fetch + git merge
- Updates your local branch and working tree

**Key idea**
- Pull = update your local work.


### git checkout
**What it does**
- Switch branches
- Restore files

**Key idea**
- Checkout = move between versions.

### git merge / git rebase
**Purpose**
- Combine changes from different branches

**Merge**
- Keeps history
- Creates a merge commit

**Rebase**
- Rewrites history
- Cleaner linear timeline

**Key idea**
- Merge joins histories, rebase rewrites them.

## Daily Git Commands
- Working directory
- Staging
- Repository
- The Art of the Commit Message
- Git Config 
   
Initialize a new Git repository. it will be Creates a hidden .git/ directory
```bash
git init
```
Check the state of files (modified, staged, untracked). Shows what’s changed and what’s ready to commit.
```bash
git status
```

Set username & email, Sets your Git username for all repositories on your system.Personal laptop, same name/email used for most projects
```bash
git config --global user.name "Nasir Uddin"
git config --global user.email "nasir@example.com"
```
Sets username only for the current repository, Multiple Git identities (work vs personal)
```bash
git config user.name "Nasir Uddin"
git config user.email "nasir@example.com"
```

View all global config.
```bash
git config --global --list
```
Displays effective configuration for the current repository.
```bash
git config --list
```
Remove a specific global config (recommended)
```bash
git config --global --unset user.name
git config --global --unset user.email
```
Moves changes from working directory to staging area, **.** add everything and Select changes for next commit.
```bash
git add app.py
git add .
```
- Saves staged changes into the repository history and Permanently save staged changes.
- Professional good commit message(Recommended Standard)

```bash
git commit -m "Add user login validation"
git commit -m "Fix API timeout issue on checkout"
git commit -m "Update Dockerfile for multi-stage build"
git commit -m "Refactor authentication service"
```

```bash
git commit -m "Add user login validation"
```

Shows full commit history,Shows commit ID, Author name & email, Date and Commit message.
```bash
git log

```
Compact, visual commit history,One line per commit and Graph shows branches and merges
```bash
git log --oneline --graph
```
Shows details of a specific commit
```bash
git show a1b2c3d
```
Shows commit history with code changes,-p means patch, shows code diffs for each commit,useful for deep review
```bash
git log -p
```

Summary of file changes per commit, Shows which files changed shows number of lines added/removed
```bash
git log --stat
```
Files Git should NOT track
- Only affects untracked files
- Cannot ignore files already committed
- Best added at the start of a project
```bash
vim .gitignore

node_modules/
.env
*.log
dist/
```

## git diff (See Changes Before Commit) 
- *diff* working directory vs staging *--staged*staging vs last commit *HEAD*everything since last commit.
```bash
git diff          
git diff --staged
git diff HEAD
```

## Undo Without Fear

You jump into that commit’s code immediately, Code looks exactly like that commit. *revert* Git will open your editor with a commit message.
```bash
git log --oneline --graph
git log --oneline
git checkout d3bf479
git branch
git checkout main
git revert 017cb9f
```

Used to discard changes in the working directory or staging area. File is restored from the last commit.
```bash
git restore README.md
```

Used to modify the last commit,Opens editor and Lets you change commit message. If already pushed, use *--force*
```bash
git commit --amend
git push --force
```

Risky, Moves HEAD and optionally clears staging & working directory. Removes last commit and Changes stay staged.
- HEAD is a pointer to your current position in Git history.
- Usually points to the current branch
- Moves when you commit
- Detached HEAD happens when you checkout a commit, not a branch

**Detached HEAD (Very common confusion)**

- Detached HEAD Warning
- You are not on a branch
- Commits may be lost unless you create a branch

```bash
git reset
```
Soft reset (keep changes staged), Moves HEAD to a specific commit but keeps all changes staged..
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

Hard reset (DANGEROUS) removes last commit. Moves HEAD to a specific commit and discards all changes in staging and working directory. Deletes all local changes and use only if you are 100% sure.
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

## Branching (Real Life Use)
- Why branches exist
- Feature branch idea
- main vs feature branch
- The Special HEAD Pointer
- Rebase

Lists, creates, or deletes branches, View active feature branches, Check where you are before merging or rebasing.
```bash
git branch
```

Creates and switches to a new branch, Create a feature branch from main. *feature/login* is a naming convention, not a requirement.
```bash
git checkout -b feature/login
```

Combines another branch into your current branch. Merge branch *feature/login* into main.

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/login
```

Allows merge only if fast-forward is possible. fast-forward merge happens when Git does NOT need to create a new commit to merge a branch.
```bash
git checkout main
git merge --ff-only feature/login
```

**conflict / no–fast-forward scenario**
```bash
# start clean
git checkout main
git commit -am "main commit 1"

# switch to feature branch (IMPORTANT)
git switch feature/login

echo "from feature" >> app.py
git add app.py
git commit -m "feature modifies app.py"

# go back to main
git switch main
echo "from main" >> app.py
git add app.py
git commit -m "main modifies app.py"

# now try ff-only
git merge --ff-only feature/login

```
*Note: A branch only moves when you commit on that branch*

Quick checklist to create merge error / no fast-forward
```bash
git branch --show-current
git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
```

Resolve the conflict and continue rebase.
```bash
git checkout feature/login
git rebase main
git add app.py
git rebase --continue
```

*--continue* Continue the rebase *--skip* If the commit in conflict is not important or you want to ignore it, *abort--* f you want to undo the rebase entirely and go back to the state before rebase.
```bash
git rebase --continue
git rebase --skip
git rebase --abort
```

Modern and safer replacement for checkout (branch switching only) **-c** Create + switch.
```bash
git switch feature/login
git switch -c feature/search
```

Downloads commits, branches, and tags from a remote without changing your working files. Does not merge or rebase automatically.
```bash
git fetch origin
```
Fetches the remote branch (origin/main) and then rebases your *current branch* on top of it.
```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```

This will move your branch back to that commit.
```bash
git log --oneline
git reflog
git switch feature/login
git reset --hard 6d61c15
```


## GitHub / GitLab Workflow
- Local vs remote
- origin
- clone vs fork
- Pull Request Workflow

Adds a new remote repository to your project
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:nasirnjs/git-test.git
git push origin main
```

Copies a remote repository to your local machine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myproject.git
```

Shows the remote repositories and URLs
```bash
git remote -v
git branch -v --verbose

```

Sends your local commits to the remote repository
```
git push
```

Pushes a new local branch to remote and sets upstream
```bash
git switch -c feature/login
git push -u origin feature/login
```

Fetches changes from the remote and merges into your current branch. *--rebase* Updates your local branch with latest commits from main
```bash
git pull origin main
git pull --rebase origin main
```

Downloads commits/branches without merging into your local branch
```bash
git fetch origin
```



## Stash + Real Scenarios
- The Stash Stack
- When to Stash vs. Commit
- Cleaning the Working Directory
- Used for hotfixes & selective commits

Temporarily saves your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged).Restores your working directory to the last commit. Useful when you want to switch branches without committing incomplete work
```bash
echo "temporary change" >> app.py
git status
git stash
git status
```
Restores the most recent stashed changes back to your working directory
```bash
git stash pop
```

Listing and Applying Specific Stashes. Shows all stashed changes and Use the index {0}, {1} to apply a specific stash.
```bash
git stash list
git stash pop 1
```
Stashing Untracked Files. Include new files in your stash using -u (or --include-untracked).
```bash
echo "new file" > newfile.txt
git stash -u
git stash list
```

Apply specific commits from another branch without merging the full branch. Useful for backporting fixes or picking only certain changes.
```bash
git checkout main
git log --oneline
git cherry-pick 4b6a61f
git cherry-pick 4b6a61f eda0b43
```
